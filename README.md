## Usage

Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (npm 5.2+) installed on your computer. Then, setup is as simple as:

* `$ npx licensed` 

If you've got an older version of node (npm version < 5.2) that doesn't yet have [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx), here's a more traditional setup:

* `$ npm i -g licensed`

Use the CLI like so, by entering the license name and then your name (in single/double quotes):

* `$ licensed mit "Mihir Chaturvedi"`

Running just `licensed` gives you a prompt to enter your name and a nice list of licenses to choose from. 

Use the `--help` flag to help you out when in grave danger.

## Available licenses to choose from (currently):

* Apache 2.0
* BSD-2-Clause
