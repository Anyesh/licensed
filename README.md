> âš– licensed is a simple, interactive command line interface to help you choose and quickly add a `LICENSE` file to your project.

## Setup

Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (npm 5.2+) installed on your computer. Then, setup is as simple as:

* `$ npx licensed` 

If you've got an older version of node (npm version < 5.2) that doesn't yet have [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx), here's a more traditional setup:

* `$ npm i -g licensed`

## Usage

After installation, navigate to your project directory ie. the directory you want your `LICENSE` file to be placed. Then:

* `$ licensed`

This will bring up an option to either **initiate a questionnaire** that will aid you in choosing and appropriate license for your project, or simply choose a license from a list of available licenses.

You can also use the CLI like so, by entering the license name and then your name (in single/double quotes):

* `$ licensed mit "Dwight Schrute"`

which will create a `LICENSE` file with the MIT License under the name Dwight Schrute.

<!-- If hell breaks loose, use the `--help` flag to help you out! -->

## Available licenses to choose from (currently):

* Apache 2.0
* BSD-2-Clause
* BSD-3-Clause
* GNU General Public License
* ISC
* MIT
* Mozilla Public License 2.0
